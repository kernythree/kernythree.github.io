I'm Mohan JULIEN, a microelectronics researcher designing open-source hardware and software that blends science, art, and fun!

My research interests lie at the intersection of technology, wildlife, and natural ecosystems, exploring innovative ways to bridge the gap between advanced electronics and environmental conservation.

Beyond research, Iâ€™m also an amateur musician and graphic artist, always exploring ways to merge technology, sound, and visuals into creative projects.
