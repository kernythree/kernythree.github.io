# About Me  

I am a freelance scientist working at the intersection of **marine research** and **technology development**. I specialize in:  

- 🐢 **Wildlife tracking** (Sea turtles, marine mammals, seabirds)  
- 📡 **LoRa & Argos telemetry**  
- 🔬 **Sensor development** for marine environments  
- 🛠 **Open-source hardware & software solutions**  

I collaborate with research institutions like **LIRMM-CNRS** and **Ifremer** to develop new monitoring tools for marine science.
